    "## Introduction\n",
    "PyTorch Gale tasks allow you to train models using `PyTorch Image Models` models, use Hydra to hotswap models, optimizers or schedulers and leverage all the advances features that Lightning has to offer, including custom Callbacks, Loggers, Accelerators and high performance scaling with minimal changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project was started as a way to collect interesting techniques dotted throughout Kaggle competitions and varous deep learning forums which have been usefull in training accuracte deep learning models for Computer Vision Tasks. \n",
    "\n",
    "Currently PyTorch Gale only supports Image Classification. The final goal is to be able to support both Object Detection and Image Segmentation hopefully.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyTorch Gale is beta software. The project is under active development and our APIs are subject to change in future releases. The current API of PyTorch Gale is highly inspired from [Detectron 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2)."

    "## How To Learn\n",
    "The best way to learn PyTorch Gale is to go through the documentation. You should probably get familiar with [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [PyTorch Lightning](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Next, go through [Hydra docs](https://hydra.cc/docs/next/intro) and [PyTorch Image Models](https://github.com/rwightman/pytorch-image-models)"
